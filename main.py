    ### üì∑ Visual Identification Tips
    
    When examining leaf images:
    
    1. **Look for concentric rings first** - The most reliable indicator of early blight
    2. **Check for white fuzzy growth** - A definitive sign of late blight
    3. **Notice lesion locations** - Early blight starts on older leaves; late blight can appear anywhere
    4. **Observe leaf margins** - Late blight often begins at leaf edges
    5. **Consider recent weather** - Cool, wet conditions favor late blight; warm humid conditions favor early blight

    ## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About This App
    **Plant Guardian** is an AI-powered tool for detecting plant diseases from leaf images.
    - üì∑ **Upload a photo** using your device.
    - üåø **Get instant disease predictions** from leaf images.
    - ü§ñ **Uses AI (Gemini API)** for enhanced image analysis and detailed disease information.
    - üöÄ **Optimized for speed** with TensorFlow & Streamlit.

    ### How It Works:
    1. **User Uploads an Image** - The image of a plant leaf is uploaded.
    2. **Image Preprocessing** - The image is resized and prepared for analysis.
    3. **Primary Classification** - The trained TensorFlow model predicts the disease.
    4. **AI Enhancement** - Gemini AI verifies and refines the prediction through advanced image analysis.
    5. **Detailed Information** - AI generates comprehensive disease descriptions and treatment plans.
    6. **Results Display** - The app shows the diagnosis, confidence score, and actionable recommendations.
    
    ### Supported Diseases:
    - **Bacterial Spot** - Dark, water-soaked lesions with yellow halos
    - **Early Blight** - Brown concentric rings, target-like patterns
    - **Late Blight** - Water-soaked patches with whitish growth underneath
    - **Healthy** - Normal appearance without disease symptoms
